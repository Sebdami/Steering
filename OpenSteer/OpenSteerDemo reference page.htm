<P>After installation <SMALL><A 
href="http://opensteer.sourceforge.net/doc.html#InstallingOpenSteer">[see doc 
section "Installing OpenSteer"]</A></SMALL> launch the OpenSteerDemo application 
which opens a window labeled "OpenSteerDemo 0.8". OpenSteerDemo has a single 
<I>selected</I> vehicle which the camera normally tracks. The user can select 
another vehicle by clicking on it with the left mouse button. OpenSteerDemo 
recognizes several single key commands:</P>

<P>The camera (or "point of view") in OpenSteerDemo is typically controlled so 
that it tracks the selected vehicle. Several different camera aiming modes are 
provided:</P>

<P>You can adjust the camera's view with the mouse: hold down the keyboard's 
<I>control </I>(Ctrl) key while dragging the mouse with its left button held 
down. 2D mouse motion is mapped into the camera's space, rotating the camera's 
position around its aimpoint. This allows the camera to move on the surface of a 
sphere centered at the aimpoint. The radius of this sphere--<WBR>the "viewing 
distance"--<WBR>can be adjusted by dragging the mouse with the middle button 
held down (vertical mouse motion maps to distance). If you use a one- or 
two-button mouse (hence no middle button) you can adjust the radius by holding 
down both the Ctrl and Alt ("control-meta-") keys while dragging the mouse with 
its left button held down.</P>
<P>Sample PlugIns: <B>Capture the Flag:</B> a single (bluish) attacker attempts 
to reach a central goal while four (reddish) defenders try to intercept ("tag") 
the attacker before it gets to the goal. Press F1 to add an obstacle (up to 100 
of them), F2 to remove one. <B>Pedestrians:</B> 100 agents follow a path (the 
red line) while avoiding collisions with each other and two large spherical 
obstacles. Press F1 to add a Pedestrian and F2 to remove one. F3 cycles among 
types of proximity databases. F4 toggles between two versions of path following. 
F5 toggles a Pedestrian's wander component on and off. <B>Boids:</B> 200 
simulated flocking "bird like objects". Press F1 to add a Boid and F2 to remove 
one. F3 cycles among types of proximity databases. F4 toggles between two 
boundary conditions. <B>Soccer:</B> a simple soccer game, blue and red teams of 
8 Players each, a green Ball and yellow field and goals. As play proceeds the 
PlugIn keeps score. <B>Multiple Pursuit:</B> a "test fixture" for the 
<I>pursue</I> behavior. 30 pursuers chase one wandering quarry. <B>Low Speed 
Turn:</B> a "test fixture" for evaluating the response of a vehicle to 
backward-pointing steering force while moving at low speed. <B>One Turning 
Away:</B> this was the first one, now it serves as a minimal example of a 
PlugIn.</P></BODY></HTML>
